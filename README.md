## Vagrant configuration and setup
Copy `/vagrant/config/vagrant-local.example.yml` to `/vagrant/config/vagrant-local.yml`, than replace `<your-personal-github-token>` with your github access token ant then run `vagrant up`.
First time will take a little longer because of all needed installations. Use `app` alias to go to the project root
